# OpenFOAM Airplane Flow Simulation

This repository contains OpenFOAM case setups for Applied CFD II Tutorials 03 and 04 at Universität Stuttgart, used as part of my learning and practice in computational fluid dynamics.

## Case Description

- **Objective:** Mesh generation with cfMesh and flow simulation around an airplane.
- **Tools:** OpenFOAM (simpleFoam), ParaView for visualization.
- **Tasks Completed:**
  1. STL preprocessing and scaling to meters.
  2. Creation of bounding box around the airplane.
  3. Local mesh refinement around the airplane.
  4. Setting boundary conditions for velocity, pressure, and walls.
  5. Flow simulation and computation of drag coefficient.
  6. Visualization of streamlines and pressure/velocity fields.
